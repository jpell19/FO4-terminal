#### Overview

This is a console app that accepts a list of word choices from the Fallout video game series terminal hacking minigame, emulated here by [Jet Holt](https://jetholt.com/hacking/).  I experimented with OpenCV to normalize and segment the console word choices from photos at different angles/lighting , but haven't got to integrating the OCR yet.
